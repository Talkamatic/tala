# Change Log
This changelog is curated and focuses on major changes. For the full historical
record before 12.0.0, see CHANGELOG.legacy.md.

## Unreleased
- Packaging: advertise and test Python 3.12 as the supported platform version.
- Documentation: clarify Tala’s role, capabilities, installation, and service
  prerequisites; add a Requestor client guide and update repository metadata.

## [31.1.0] - 2026-10-28
- Requestor: forward strict JSON Schema response formats, expose completion
  outcomes, and include output schemas in cache identity.
- Requestor: raise `GPTStructuredOutputError` for malformed structured JSON
  instead of silently returning a default response.

## [31.0.2] - 2026-10-21
- DDD XML: ignore formatting whitespace in `forget` and `forget_shared`
  proposition children. This fixes a compilation failure with normally
  indented XML; comments around the proposition child are also supported.

## [31.0.1] - 2026-10-20
- DDD JSON: validate definition schemas and fixtures; correct KPQ, condition,
  forget, and bundle schema definitions.

## [31.0.0] - 2026-10-19
- CLI: remove the deprecated multi-command `tala` interface; use
  `tala-interact` as the supported interaction command.
- DDD JSON: add loading for bundled and separate component definitions, with
  named component formats.
- DDD language: add boolean and belief/commitment membership conditions, and
  remove implicit service-action downdating in favor of explicit conditions.
- DDD loading: add active-DDD validation, require non-empty DDD name lists, and
  harden numeric coercion.
- Serialization: expand JSON:API support for dialogue events, moves, plans, and
  iterator state; tighten serialization and deserialization.
- Orchestration: preserve the configured `AUTO` TIS log format and reduce
  duplicated payload data.
- Streaming: add connection timeouts and handle client setup failures without
  leaving streamer workers blocked; run worker threads as daemons.
- Configuration: update the default GPT model to `gpt-4o-2024-11-20` and let
  test logging use `LOG_LEVEL` when no explicit level is provided.

## [30.0.1] - 2026-05-08
- JSON parsing: restore support for legacy `service_action` plan items and
  service-result propositions.

## Highlights since 12.0.0 (major changes only)
